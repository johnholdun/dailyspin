It uses a number of advanced CSS techniques. As of this writing, the full experience only works well in Chrome.
Those techniques are:

+ Flex box
+ Animation
+ Transforms
+ Filters
+ Columns

It uses sass[1] and here's the command I run when I'm developing:
    sass --scss --watch sass:public/css

The stock headlines are pulled into a csv from the `t` command line tool[2].
    t timeline --number=42 --csv twoheadlines > headlines.csv
